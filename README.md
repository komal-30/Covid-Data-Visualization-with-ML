# Covid Data Visualization Using Machine Learning
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. 
By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization 
tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and
patterns in data.

We have visualized live covid data using different python libraries like:
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Plotly

The project is built using the live Covid-19 data set and analysing the data using different python libraries .
The project demonstrates the global infection rate of Covid-19,status before lockdown,situations and infection rate after lockdown.Death rate versus the recovery rate.
Rate of infection in India and across the globe,etc.
